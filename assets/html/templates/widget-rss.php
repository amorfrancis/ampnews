			<div class="rssSummary">TL;DR: We are making changes to how AMP works in platforms such as Google Search
				that will enable linked pages to appear under publishers’ URLs instead of the google.com/amp URL
				space while maintaining the performance and privacy benefits of AMP Cache serving. When we first

			<div class="rssSummary">The following was&nbsp;posted on LaterPay’s Blog&nbsp;by Cosmin Ene, CEO,
				LaterPay. A majority of mobile users will not wait longer than&nbsp;3 seconds&nbsp;for a page to
