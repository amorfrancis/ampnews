		<p>The photo shows Carrie Underwood and Below Deck star, Adrienne Gang. The two women bumped into each other at
			a gym, and Gang shared a photo that that she had someone take of her and the country star after their
			workout.</p>

		<p>This picture is now being scrutinized. Here’s why.</p>

		<p>In November, Underwood revealed that she fell on the front stairs of her home. Not only did she end up
			breaking her wrist in the fall, but she also hurt her face and needed surgery. In a recent post on her fan
			page, Underwood revealed that she needed 40-50 stitches in her face and that her facial injury was a lot
			more serious than she had initially let on.</p>

		<p>“There is also another part of the story that I haven’t been ready to talk about since I have still been
			living it and there has been much uncertainty as to how things will end up. It’s crazy how a freak random
			accident can change your life,” she wrote in a blog post, according to Entertainment Tonight. “In addition
			to breaking my wrist, I somehow managed to injure my face as well. I’ll spare you the gruesome details, but
			when I came out of surgery the night of my fall, the doctor told [Underwood’s husband] Mike that he had put
			between 40 and 50 stitches in,” she added.</p>

		</ul>

		<p>Underwood went on to say that she is still healing now, about seven weeks after the fall. She told her fans
			that she “might look a bit different” following the accident.</p>

		<p>“I honestly don’t know how things are going to end up but I do know this: I am grateful,” she adds. “I am
			grateful that it wasn’t much, much worse. And I am grateful for the people in my life that have been there
			every step of the way. I am determined to make 2018 amazing and I want to share things with you along the
			way. And when I am ready to get in front of a camera, I want you all to understand why I might look a bit
			different,” she wrote.</p>
